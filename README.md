# sofun.hs
An Interpreter for Sofun (Stack-Oriented FUNctional programming language) written in haskell.
Improvements over the c++ version:
* More than 10 times faster
* Now with a basic type system (more types to be added soon)
* More and better error messages, less edge cases
* far more elegant code ;)
